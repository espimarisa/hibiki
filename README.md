# Hibiki Development ("Project Phoenix")

This branch is currently in active development and is in no means ready for production.

## About

This branch tracks the eventual "refresh" of the Hibiki project. More documentation will be provided at a later date.

## TL;DR

- Ditch Node.js, use Bun.js
- Ditch Eris, use Oceanic.js or Discordeno
- Ditch RethinkDB, use PostgreSQL
- Ditch nginx, use Caddy
- Swap to slash commands (5 years too late)
- Properly containerize using Docker
- Focus on informational utilities instead of being a "kitchen sink"
