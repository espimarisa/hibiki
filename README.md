[Hibiki][hibiki] is an easy, customizable, and powerful all-in-one Discord bot that does anything that your server needs.

Written in [TypeScript][typescript] and powered by [Eris][eris] and [Node.js][nodejs], Hibiki is designed to have the perfect blend of customizability, ease-of-use, and stability. Unlike most Discord bots, Hibiki is both simple to use but also very tweakable and powerful.

## Invite

You can invite Hibiki using [this Discord link][invite]. The only official instance of Hibiki is `Hibiki#1448 (493904957523623936)`. By inviting Hibiki, you agree to our [privacy policy][privacy].

Additionally, we don't support self-hosting or give support/answer questions for doing such. However, the bot is easily self hostable with some basic knowledge.
